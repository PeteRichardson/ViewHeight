# ViewHeight
A simple text viewer app to practice managing scrolling text files.

Text is stored as individual lines and displayed in a ZStack, instead of just a string in a TextEditor. This allows a switch to AttributedStrings for styling[^1]

[^1]: not needed once macOS 26 comes out with AttributedString support in TextEditor.
